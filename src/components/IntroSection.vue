      This fully-fledged Vue app utilizes the power of ml5.js, a machine
      learning JavaScript library, to enable users to identify objects in
      images. Notably, users have the flexibility to choose from various object
      detection models such as CocoSsd or YOLO. Additionally, the app shows the
      number of detected objects along with their corresponding labels, and
      confidence scores. Please note that the performance of object detection
      models relies on the quality of the input image and the inherent
      limitations of the models(CocoSsd or YOLO) themselves.
