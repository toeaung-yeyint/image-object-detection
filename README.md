# Project description

This app can detect objects (e.g. a person object from an image with a person in it) and display the objects along with their respective confidence score. This app was built using the JS library called ml5.js, however, the detection system is not 100% perfect.

## Project specifications

- If a user uploads an image, the app will detect objects from an image
- If a user clicks on rest button, the result section and the upload input field will be clear
- If a user upload again, the result section with the previous image and the upload input field will be clear
- On desktop devices, users will see the detected objects with square boxes around them
- On mobile devices, users will see the detected objects as a list
