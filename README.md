# Project description

This fully-fledged Vue app utilizes the power of ml5.js, a machine learning JavaScript library, to enable users to identify objects in images. Notably, users have the flexibility to choose from various object detection models such as CocoSsd or YOLO. Additionally, the app shows the detected objects along with their corresponding labels, and confidence scores. Please note that the performance of object detection models relies on the quality of the input image and the inherent limitations of the models(CocoSsd or YOLO) themselves.
